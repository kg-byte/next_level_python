# Welcome to the Next Level Python Course

This class will give you a deeper understanding of Python and allow you to write better code much faster. The class is curated and contains the topics that I think will be the most beneficial to you if you want to become more skilled at Python.

This is what is covered in the course:

* **Advanced usage of classes** including dataclasses, properties and more
* **Concurrent programming techniques** with asyncio to optimize how your code interacts with APIs
* How to **allocate and release resources**
* What **type annotations** are and why it's important that you use them
* **Advanced functional programming** using lambda functions, partial function application and more
* **Advanced control logic** using iterators and generators

Before you start going through the course material, make sure to have the repo cloned locally so you can fetch updates that might come in the future. The exercises are for you to edit, for each exercise there are a solution file. 

We **strongly** advise you to try solving the exercise first before looking at the solution. The majority of exercises will have unit tests in the test.py file, if you feel that you are getting stuck, you can use the unit tests are hints. Furthermore, make sure you don't read the comments section since several people post their answers as a comment.

So, if you're ready - let's dive in!

## **Do you want to help?**
We at arjancodes would love too hear suggestions, improvements and more to the courses. Is there a *missing test*?, Is there a *typo* somewhere? Or is there an exercise that *should* exist? Then contact support@arjancodes.com or simply make a PR, which will be reviewed, with the changes and updates you want to have.
