# Python Data Analysis Tool using API
In this project, you will develop a Python tool that interacts with an API, retrieves data and do data analysis on the data. There are a ton of free APIs and you can use any of them, but we recommend that you use one of the following:

### Free APIs

* [Bored](https://www.boredapi.com/)
* [agify.io](https://agify.io/)
* [WorlPop](https://www.worldpop.org/sdi/introapi/)


## Description
In this project, you will develop a Python tool that interacts with one of the apis to retrieve data and performs insightful analysis. This project not only serves as a hands-on exercise in working with APIs but also allows you to delve into data manipulation and analysis using Python.

Explore one of the above APIs documentation to understand the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.
Implement Python functions to make HTTP requests to the API and handle the responses. Use libraries such as requests to simplify the communication process.

## Key Components
* **Data Retrieval:** Design a mechanism to retrieve data from API.
* **Data Analysis:** Leverage popular data analysis libraries like pandas to process and manipulate the retrieved data efficiently. 
* **Testing:** Testing is not covered in this course, but try implementing some unit test for some functions or classes. If you are stuck, try using an ai to assist you in the written on the unittests.
* **Documentation:** Create documentation for your project, including a readme on how to setup and run the project, shorter explanations of the analysis performed, and any other technical details relevant.


## Suggestions
* Time Series Analysis: Extend your tool to perform time-series analysis on the population data. Identify trends, growth rates, or any significant changes over time.
* Geospatial Analysis: Explore geospatial aspects of the population data. Use libraries like geopandas to visualize population distributions on a map.
* Comparative Studies: Allow users to compare population data across different regions, countries, or continents. Implement functionalities that facilitate comparative studies and generate insightful reports.

### Beginner
* Create a "Random Activity Generator" that suggests fun and interesting activities when a user is bored with bored api.

* Develop an application that predicts the likely age of a person based on their name using agify api.

* Build a tool that retrieves population data for different regions/countries using the WorldPop API.

### Intermediate
* Use the Bored API to suggest activities based on predicted age from Agify.io. Allow users of your project to customize their experience by selecting preferences and filters for activity suggestions.


## Recommendation
Adhere to best coding practices, including code readability, modularization, and proper documentation. Implement error-handling mechanisms to manage potential issues with API requests or data processing. Implement unit testing for the program you have created, to ensure its robustness and reliability. Remember, this is for your learning try new stuff and be not afraid to make mistakes, learn from them, and improve your work.

Lastly, use the course as an foundation for the project, use principles that have been covered and take time to think through the soluttion. 

## Submission

We don't do submissions for this project, it is simply for your own practice.

Good luck! :D
